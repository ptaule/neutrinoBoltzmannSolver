# Exact Boltzmann solution for massive neutrinos

This repo implements analytic solutions for the Boltzmann eqs. for massive
neutrinos, as given in Shoji&Komatsu '08. Some assumptions are made:

- EdS cosmology so that the grav. potentials are constant during matter domination.
- No backreaction from neutrinos on the grav. potentials
- With the above assumtions, the gravitational potential psi cancels out in
  ratios of perturbations, hence it is not included.
